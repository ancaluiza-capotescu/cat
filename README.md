#3D CAT

## Description
The cat can:
- rotate on mouse move
- move (left-right, up-down) using keyboard arrows
- change position (mouse click)
- regain its initial position (double mouse click)
- jump (Space)
- meow (Enter)

The page has a background sound (the sound might stop on page reload but it resumes by pressing 'Enter').

I used the 'Live Server' extension given by Visual Studio Code in order to simulate a server (just simply double-clicking on index.html does not work correctly).
I also uploaded the project here: http://info.tm.edu.ro:8080/~ACapotescu/cat/
